<h1>Book Of Trump</h1>
<p>Introducing the BOOK OF TRUMP: an experimental project poised to redefine political culture by amalgamating Trump memes, decentralized storage solutions, and trading in degen cryptocurrencies. This experiment endeavors to encapsulate the ever-evolving narrative surrounding Donald Trump within a digital compendium, the BOOK OF TRUMP, ensuring each piece is immortalized on the blockchain. The $BOTP memecoin on Solana, Arweave, and IPFS as the primary storage of Book Of Trump and future expansions to Bitcoin inscriptions as immutable forever storage, this initiative aims to foster a new dimension of decentralized social media, and make Trump memes unstoppable.</p>
<br>
<h2>Memecoin on the most Degen chain + This digital book is linked with metadata to the token and the Book has even more links to images stored on IPFS/ARWEAVE/ONCHAIN + A decentralized social network app + Tools to create Trump-themed memes + CC0 Trump Meme Clipart Collection - all of these here in one memecoin!</h2>

<h2>No exact price; all the presale tokens will be allocated by % of contribution during 24h mint, and please do not dust the address or you could get nothing during airdrop</h2>
<h2>After the airdrop, I will create 1 or 2 liquidity pools with a higher starting price per $BOTP so you can try to dump tokens fast lol.</h2>
*Disclaimer: I used DEX a lot and lost a lot, but still have no idea what I am doing*
